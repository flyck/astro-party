# Astro Party

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/386bf1a3-4b24-4181-8ddc-79ba6c952f20/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/flyck-astro-party/deploys)

An experiment with the new astro db to re-implement the
[party-task-planner](https://github.com/flyck/party-task-planner) with astro, astro server, astro
db and htmx.

With this stack (hopefully) CRUD apps can be created easily, as all frontend actions can be
implemented via the htmx abstraction, the templates come from the astro server, and the data is in
a simple astro database which has a great integration with astro db and drizzle ORM.

## Powered by Astro

Used the Astro minimal starter kit:
```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template minimal
```

  - [ ] Have better toast messages with a proper library ([js-snackbar](https://www.michaelmickelson.com/js-snackbar/)?)
  - [ ] Navigate left-right on desktop via arrow keys
- Github Actions
  - [ ] Biome Linting
  - [ ] Nice releases

## Dev Notes

- Doing a db schema changes from date to string was as easy as changing the schema in the
  `db/config.ts`, removing the frontend type conversion and running a `npm run astro db push` üëè
- AstroDBs local behavior with sqlite is different from the prod deployment. Locally I always get
  the insert / delete status back. On deployment that is always empty
  - Fixed by request it specifically with `.returning()`
- When I deploy from local there is a dependency missing from the build: `Cannot find module
  '@libsql/linux-x64-gnu'`
  - Fixed by downgrading @libsql/client: https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql-client-ts/issues/112
- Htmx with Astro View Transitions
  - https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/discussions/692 htmx.trigger works for multiple events,
    the native browser events will only work once
  - Using htmx.trigger() will send an event, but htmx will not process it. Only `htmx.process()`
    works
    - Supported by https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/issues/2011
  - https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/issues/1761 a proper plugin?

### Utils

Useful to verify skeletons:
```typescript
await new Promise<void>((res) => setTimeout(() => {console.log(":)"); res()}, 2000))
return new Response(JSON.stringify({ ok: true }), {
    status: 200,
  })
```
